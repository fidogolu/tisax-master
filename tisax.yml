        examples_normal_protection: |
          Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
          It is crucial for this evaluation, whether the contractor’s work includes
          1) gaining access to information or security zones of the company with normal protection needs regarding confidentiality; or
          2) providing or being able to modify relevant information with normal protection needs regarding integrity; or
          3) having relevant influence on processes or IT systems with normal protection needs regarding availability (comp. to internal or customer-related SLAs).
          Typical contractors with normal protection needs are e.g. cleaning services for general areas, classic logistics companies or maintenance staff.

          The minimum requirements for information security (in relation to the respective protection goal) should be defined in a policy (e.g. information security policy for service providers). These requirements can be based on the requirements of the ISA described herein in addition to the company-specific requirements. This policy can be supplemented according to the specific order.

          Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
          The security requirements should be made known to the contractor, e.g. at procurement, in briefings (project meetings) by corresponding documents (e.g. information security policy for service providers) or when entering the premises (in case of contractors providing their services on site). Compliance with the information security requirements should be contractually fixed. At this point already, potential further subcontractors of the contractor should also be considered, as relevant. This can be done by individual agreements such as general terms and conditions of purchase, for example.  In many cases, suppliers (e.g. IT service providers) already assure compliance with security requirements in their standard contracts.

          In order to ensure compliance with the requirements in a suitable manner, simple mechanisms should be established. This may include, for example:
          - The submission of at least a self-disclosure confirmed by the management (e.g. VDA ISA) or an adequate attestation/certificate
          - The right to and execution of irregular sampling and event-related inspections.
        further_informations: |
          Within the context of VDA ISA, the term contractor includes both classic suppliers and subcontractors but also classic service providers, freelancers or other partner companies. It also includes cooperation partners (e.g. academic institutions, institutes).

          The explanations below describe a possible procedure for fulfilling the requirements:

          Identification of contractors and specification of protection needs and security requirements:
          At first, all contractors must be identified (e.g. via the list of creditors of the accountants department) in order to gain an initial overview. 
          For all contractors, the respective protection needs should be specified and the security requirements derived according to their tasks and the relevance to own and customer’s processes. 
          Generally, a large number of contractors is found not to require the assignment of relevant protection needs and to be therefore not subject to security requirements (e.g. suppliers of office stationary). 

          Ensuring implementation by the contractor:
          In the next step, the applicable requirements must be made known to all security-relevant contractors in a suitable manner and (contractually) fixed as being mandatory. Finally, a decision should be made as to how the implementation of the security requirements can be appropriately verified. For this purpose, adequate verification processes and procedures should be defined according to the respective risk (and the associated protection needs). Their purpose is to ensure that contractors implement the necessary requirements.

          Establishment in standard processes:
          The insights gained should be used to develop a comprehensible procedure and to integrate it into the existing processes of the B2B / supplier management. This starts with the selection of the contractor, where aspects of information security should already be taken into account alongside criteria such as quality, adherence to delivery dates, credit rating etc. The procurement process should be such that the relevance of information security has already been taken into account beforehand (with respect to the procurement decision; contract design; inspection requirements).
          Furthermore, it is recommended to incorporate information security aspects into existing processes for supplier evaluation which have already been established by e.g. an existing quality management system.
          Contractually specified deliverables (e.g. availability requirements) should be verified at regular intervals. This can be done by e.g. regular analysis of service reports and SLAs.
